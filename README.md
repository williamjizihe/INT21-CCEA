# ENSTA Paris INT21 Project

This repository is for the project of INT21 course at ENSTA Paris. It includes the implementation of four distinct algorithms aimed at solving a specific optimization problem: maximizing area coverage with a minimum number of lamps.

Algorithms Used:

- Two classic algorithms (Variable Length Evolutionary Algorithm and NSGA-II), the implementation of which can be found in 'lamp_classic_algo.ipynb'.

- Group Evolution: This is a cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm. The implementation is available in 'lamp_group_evolution.ipynb'.

- Parisian Evolution: Another cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm. The implementation of this algorithm will be uploaded soon.

## Libraries Used

```plaintext
- Python 3.9.5
- imageio==2.20.0
- inspyred==1.0.1
- matplotlib==3.4.2
- numpy==1.21.6
```
